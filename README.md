# GPT‑4 API Chatbot

A simple chatbot built with Next.js and the OpenAI GPT‑4 API, following the FreeCodeCamp tutorial:  
[Build GPT‑4 API Chatbot Tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-gpt-4-api-chatbot-turorial/)

---

## 🧰 Features

- Chat interface using Next.js (app or pages directory)
- Integration with OpenAI GPT‑4 API
- Sends user queries to the backend API route
- Receives AI responses and displays them
- Keyboard shortcuts and loading indicators for better UX

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gyan0706/Chatbot-using-gpt4.git
cd Chatbot-using-gpt4
````

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or, if you're using yarn:
# yarn
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration

This project loads your OpenAI API key from an environment variable. Use an `env.js` file (ignored by Git) to keep your key secure.

### 1. Create an `env.js` file in your project root:

```js
// env.js
export const OPENAI_API_KEY = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;
```

### 2. Create a `.env` file:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-real-openai-api-key
```

### 3. Make sure your `.gitignore` includes:

```
env.js
.env
.next
node_modules
```

This ensures your API key remains private.

---

## 🔁 Running the Project

### Development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000` to chat with the AI.

### Production build:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## 💡 Notes

* Use your own OpenAI API key and ensure it’s active.
* Be mindful of usage costs — GPT‑4 incurs charges per token.
* This is a demo/template; feel free to extend it (e.g., multiple conversation threads, context preservation).
